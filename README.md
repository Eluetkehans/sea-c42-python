I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a major in
German and a minor in Russian. I got my CELTA English teaching certification
in the hopes of teaching English in Russia or Ukraine, but then Russia
invaded Ukraine. Consiquently, I am now a retail manager. As you may know,
retail is a terrible, terrible place to be, where the future is grim, and the
pay is just enough to survive on.

Other fun things about me: I also speak a bit of Portuguese, I am a third
degree black belt in Teakwondo, I dance salsa, I play guitar, and I love to
cook!

I hope to get in to game development, but I am looking to get into anything
that won't have me scraping my way from pay check to pay check.
