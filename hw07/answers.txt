Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

...

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

seq and linenum never get defined, so when the program tries to call
them later, an exception is thrown.

If you comment out gc_count = 0, then the gc_count variable will not be
defined and an exception will be thrown.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518


Problem 5:

G-count: 5738773
C-count: 5879128
A-count: 7701287
T-count: 7661547

Problem 6:

The sum of G, C, A, and T differ from the seq length and total count in
all files but the test file. Inside the lines of sequence, there are 
some unexplained "N"s.

I did have to change my code, because only the sum of the G, C, A, and T
count should be used in the denominator because it is the only one that
does not include the renegade N's

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

None

Reflection:

I learned to check through your data to see if there are any
inconsitancies. I also learned that you have to continually check to
make sure things are operating how they are supposed to, and to have
some known, simple results that you can use to check your work against.
I also learned that naming your variables well help you to understand
the code better.
